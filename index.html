        <h2>The American Dream?</h2>
        <p>We often hear that <span class="highlight">hard work</span> and <span class="highlight">economic growth</span> are the keys to upward mobility. But what does the data actually tell us?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="1">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>The Myth of Job Growth</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-negative">+0.05</span></p>
        <p>Cities with booming job markets don't necessarily create better outcomes for children from low-income families. The relationship is virtually non-existent.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="2">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Higher Wages Aren't Enough</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-negative">+0.08</span></p>
        <p>Even rising wages in an area show minimal impact on long-term economic mobility. The problem runs deeper than paychecks.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="3">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>The Reality: Poverty Matters</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-negative">-0.55</span></p>
        <p>Areas with higher poverty rates show <span class="highlight-negative">significantly lower mobility</span>. Concentrated poverty creates powerful barriers that persist across generations.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="4">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Education Opens Doors</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight">+0.52</span></p>
        <p>Communities with more college-educated adults provide better opportunities for <span class="highlight">all children</span> in the area—not just their own.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="5">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Family Stability</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight">+0.48</span></p>
        <p>Areas with more stable family structures show significantly better mobility outcomes, even after controlling for income levels.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="6">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Environmental Justice</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-negative">-0.42</span></p>
        <p>Even <span class="highlight-negative">air quality</span> affects economic outcomes. Higher pollution levels correlate with lower mobility—environmental injustice becomes economic injustice.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="7">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Community Roots</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight">+0.36</span></p>
        <p>Higher homeownership rates indicate community stability, which benefits children's long-term economic prospects.</p>

    <div class="outro-content">
      <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
      <p>Economic mobility isn't just about jobs and wages. It's shaped by <span class="highlight">social structures</span>, <span class="highlight">community resources</span>, and <span class="highlight">environmental conditions</span> that create—or limit—opportunity.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:30px;font-style:italic">Understanding these connections is the first step toward building more equitable communities.</p>
