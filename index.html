        <h2>The American Dream?</h2>
        <p>We often hear that <span class="highlight">hard work</span> and <span class="highlight">economic growth</span> are the keys to upward mobility. But what does the data actually tell us?</p>

          <h2>The Rent Paradox</h2>
          <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-neutral">+0.44</span></p>
          <p>Higher rent areas show only <span class="highlight-neutral">moderate correlation</span> with better outcomes. Rent explains just <span class="highlight-neutral">12.5%</span> of mobility variation—meaning expensive doesn't always mean better opportunity.</p>

        <div class="step-content">
          <h2>Opportunity Bargains Exist</h2>
          <p>The weak rent-mobility link reveals something powerful: <span class="highlight">affordable high-opportunity neighborhoods</span> are common enough to form patterns.</p>
          <p>Families may lack information about these areas, or face non-financial barriers to moving there.</p>

      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>The Myth of Job Growth</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-negative">+0.05</span></p>
        <p>Cities with booming job markets don't necessarily create better outcomes for children from low-income families. The relationship is virtually non-existent.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="4">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Higher Wages Aren't Enough</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-negative">+0.08</span></p>
        <p>Even rising wages in an area show minimal impact on long-term economic mobility. The problem runs deeper than paychecks.</p>

      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>The Reality: Poverty Matters</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-negative">-0.55</span></p>
        <p>Areas with higher poverty rates show <span class="highlight-negative">significantly lower mobility</span>. Concentrated poverty creates powerful barriers that persist across generations.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="6">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Education Opens Doors</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight">+0.52</span></p>
        <p>Communities with more college-educated adults provide better opportunities for <span class="highlight">all children</span> in the area—not just their own.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="7">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Family Stability</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight">+0.48</span></p>
        <p>Areas with more stable family structures show significantly better mobility outcomes, even after controlling for income levels.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="step" data-step="8">
      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Environmental Justice</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight-negative">-0.42</span></p>
        <p>Even <span class="highlight-negative">air quality</span> affects economic outcomes. Higher pollution levels correlate with lower mobility—environmental injustice becomes economic injustice.</p>

        <h2>Community Roots</h2>
        <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight">+0.36</span></p>
        <p>Higher homeownership rates indicate community stability, which benefits children's long-term economic prospects.</p>

      <h2>Rent's Moderate Impact</h2>
      <p>Correlation: <span class="highlight">+0.35</span></p>
      <p>When we look at rent levels themselves, they show a <span class="highlight">moderate positive effect</span>—but far weaker than social factors like poverty concentration and education.</p>

    <div class="outro-content">
      <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
     <p>Economic mobility isn't driven by what we expect. <span class="highlight-negative">Job growth, wages, and GDP</span> show virtually no relationship with children's outcomes. Even <span class="highlight-neutral">higher rents</span>—often assumed to signal better neighborhoods—explain only a small fraction of mobility variation.</p>
    
     <p>What matters most is <span class="highlight">who lives in your neighborhood</span>: poverty concentration, education levels, and family stability are the real drivers. These social factors create—or destroy—opportunity regardless of economic dynamism.</p>
    
     <p>The discovery of widespread <span class="highlight">"opportunity bargains"</span>—affordable neighborhoods with high mobility—reveals a critical insight: <span class="highlight">expensive doesn't mean better</span>. Families may simply lack information about where these high-opportunity areas are, or face invisible barriers to moving there.</p>
    
     <p style="margin-top:30px;font-style:italic">Understanding these patterns is the first step toward building policies that help families access opportunity—not just afford housing, but find the right neighborhoods that will truly change their children's futures.</p>
